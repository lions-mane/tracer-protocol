https://tracer.finance

This repository contains the smart contract source code powering the Tracer perpetual swaps protocol.

For a brief overview of each core contract, view [contracts/README_Contracts.md](./contracts/README_Contracts.md).

For an explanation of each error code, view [contracts/README_Errors.md](./contracts/README_Errors.md).

## Install

```
yarn install
```
## Test
Testing uses the [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) framework

To run all tests
```
yarn test
```
To run individual test files, use
```
yarn hardhat test <PATH_TO_TEST>
```
## Deployment
Hardhat does not support native deployments. To aid in deployment, hardhat-deploy is being used. You can see the deployment scripts in the `/deploy` directory.

Tracer also supports programmatic verification of contracts during deployment. Use the `hardhat.config.js` file to set your Etherscan API key in order for this to be enabled.

To run deploys to a live network
```
yarn hardhat deploy --network NETWORK --tags LiveDeploy
```
This will run the `LiveDeployment` script which is made to deploy to a real network. If there are any issues with verification, you may run
```
yarn hardhat deploy --network NETWORK --tags LiveVerify
```
in order to reverify any deployed contracts.

Some helper scripts have also been created to run deployments and add supporting function calls. For example, `DeployAndAddTracer.js` runs the `FullDeploy.js` file and then creates a Tracer market with this deployment.

To run a specific script, run
```
yarn hardhat run <PATH_TO_SCRIPT>
```

## Code Coverage ##

To generate code coverage metrics via instrumented runs of the testing suite, use:

```sh
yarn hardhat coverage
```

A few important things to keep in mind:

 - Code size reports generated by this command (via `contract-sizer`) **cannot** be trusted as the instrumentation greatly bloats the generated bytecode
 - Running times for tests also cannot be trusted due to the increased overhead of test instrumentation
